Jigsaw
======
This app is all about exploring what can be done with bitmaps in android. The idea is simple - a jigsaw puzzle. 
Manipulate an image, create bitmaps, mask them, jumble them and let the users have fun reassembling them.

Progress so far:<br>
1. Game logic implemented.<br>
2. In playable condition with game logic.<br>
3. Works well with phones, not so much with tablets.<br>

TBD:<br>
1. Add features like: reverse your moves(go back in history), game cheats/help, bitmap masking(cool looking pieces, not rectangular)<br>
2. Improve the front page. Pretty crappy right now.<br>
3. Collect stats from the game.<br>
4. Add incentives for players to get them more involved.<br>
5. Support multiple screens.<br>
5. ...and more!<br>
