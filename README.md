Jigsaw
======

This app is all about exploring what can be done with bitmaps in android. The idea is simple - a jigsaw puzzle. 
Manipulate an image, create bitmaps, mask them, jumble them and let the users have fun reassembling them.

Progress so far:
1. Game logic implemented.
2. In playable condition with game logic. 
3. Works well with phones, not so much with tablets.

TBD:
1. Add features like: reverse your moves(go back in history), game cheats/help, bitmap masking(cool looking pieces, not rectangular)
2. Improve the front page. Pretty crappy right now.
3. Collect stats from the game.
4. Add incentives for players to get them more involved.
5. Support multiple screens.
5. ...and more!
